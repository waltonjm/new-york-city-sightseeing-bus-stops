# **New York City Map Animation**
## Description
MIT xProÂ® Professional Certificate in Coding Boot Camp Project: Real Time Bus Tracker. This entails tracking bus stops between the MIT Campus and Harvard Campus located in Boston, Massachusetts.

## Installation
mapboxgl: JavaScript (JS) Library that is part of the mapbox ecosystem. 

## Usage
This project demonstrated how to work with the document Object Model (DOM) to add animation to maps. Go to mapbox.com to obtain a free Application Programming Interface (API) key to test out mapbox. Mapbox is an open-source platform which allows developers to create and display (a limited number of times) maps on a web page. Using the mapboxgl JS libary, developers can add customizations to their maps such as markers as in the case of this boot camp project.

## Support
Go to: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/ for documentation.
Go to: https://new.mta.info/developers for more developer resources including new, public APIs.

## Roadmap
This project will be presented as a part of student boot camp portfolio.
